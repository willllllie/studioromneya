              Studio Romneya is a garden and landscape studio based in South London, working with gardens and projects of all sizes. We offer garden consultations, education, events, and ongoing maintenance, supporting people at every stage of their relationship with their outdoor space. </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              The studio is guided by a deep care for the environment and the belief that gardens should benefit soil, plants, and people alike. Our planting ethos focuses on putting the right plants in the right places, creating spaces that are beautiful, functional, and resilient over time. We begin by understanding what is already there — the conditions, the plants, and the health of the garden — before working collaboratively on a clear and achievable plan for its future.</p>
           
            <p class="body-text">
              Our name comes from <i>romneya coulteri</i>, the native tree poppy that grows wild throughout California — a plant that reflects our approach: responsive to place, shaped by its conditions, and quietly abundant.</p>
